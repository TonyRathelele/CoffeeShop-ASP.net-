Coffee Product Images Placeholder

For a production coffee website, you would place the following images here:

1. ethiopian-yirgacheffe.jpg - Light roast single origin coffee
2. italian-espresso.jpg - Dark roast espresso blend
3. colombian-supremo.jpg - Medium roast Colombian coffee
4. cold-brew.jpg - Cold brew concentrate
5. swiss-decaf.jpg - Decaffeinated coffee

These images should be high-quality product photos showing:
- Coffee beans in attractive packaging
- Consistent lighting and background
- Professional product photography
- Optimized for web (compressed but high quality)
- Recommended size: 400x400px minimum

For now, the application uses placeholder URLs from Unsplash for demonstration.
